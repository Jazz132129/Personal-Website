# Personal-Website

https://jazzrudolph.github.io/Personal-Website/

My project is a simple personal website that I will display my future projects on it, 
so my future employeer and clients can see my skills.

You will use this website for getting into contact with me for questions or consultations. 
Also viewing my work and learning a little about me and my journey of coding.

I used html and css. I also used google fonts, font awesome, and a very small amount of bootstrap.

Future improvements will consist of a more appealing form on my page, 
replacing the canva pictures of websites and adding my future projects,
lastly adding some javascript to it once I know how to work with it.
