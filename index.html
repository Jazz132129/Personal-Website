          My name is Jazz Rudolph. I recieved my Full Stack Web Development Certificate from FAU bootcamp a month ago. Now, I am
          looking for my first full-time job.  I can say with confidence that I know what I want out of my career, and I have goal set to get there.  The world of technology is changing rapidly, and I know that I can provide a fresh take and an
          extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to
          challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new
          things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my
          skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products
          <br />
          My name is Justin Baker, and I decided to change my occupation after
          five years of working in sales. I still like communicating with people
          and work in a team. I want to alter the accents a bit and switch to
          product management. As a sales agent, I learned what makes a product
          valuable and easy to sell besides promotion and persuasiveness. I have
          been working “on the other side” long enough to realize how important
          marketing and development components are. I have become interested in
          these fields recently. I am certain that joining your team is a
          benefit for both sides. My professional expertise in sales can provide
          valuable insights and a fresh perspective on product development.
          Personally, I can acquire new knowledge and skills in product launch
          and management. I am ready for long-time cooperation.
